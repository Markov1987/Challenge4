##Overview of the school district analysis

A quick overview of the information received shows we are analyzing information for 15 schools including over 39 k students. On this basis, for each student, we have general information such as name, id, school, grade, gender, and results for math and reading exams:

For the 15 registered schools we developed a district analysis to summarize budget, students headcount, and academical results as follows:

We received the notification that there seems altered notes identified at 9 graders from Thomas High School, thus, we excluded them from the basis:

##Results

A new analysis was executed after modifying the basis and some interesting conclusions can be reached:

Note: 

1) Thomas High School's performance was substantially better than previously thought, in fact, is the second-best school with a 90.63% overall passing. 
2) This higher performance supports achieved with the updated data confirm:
        2.1) Higher spending ends showing better results. 
        2.2) Medium/ Small schools have better results. 
        2.3) Charter schools got better results. 


##Summary

There seems to be evidence that Thomas High School was modified, removing the 9th grades (28% of the basis) completely modifies the results of the analysis moving the school from one of the worst results to the second-best performance among all. 

This confirms some conclusions we had before where Thomas High School seemed to be an outlier but it was not.
